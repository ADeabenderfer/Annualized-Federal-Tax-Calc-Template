Template to calculate annualized federal taxes for 3 pay periods

Federal payroll taxes can be quite confusing and it should be no surprise that many employees write in asking about this tax on their paychecks. It was discovered that the best way to explain this tax was by presenting the employee with a breakdown.

Tax analysts in the past used the FIT Steps PDF to manually tpye out and present a breakdown to employees upon request. 

Within a week of processing employee requests, I was tired of manually typing out each step from the PDF and created a template to process these requests quicker.

This template is still used today by analysts
