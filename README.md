| **Project Overview**   | Template designed to calculate annualized federal taxes for 3 pay periods, providing clear tax breakdowns for employees.                                                                                                     |
| **Problem Addressed**  | Federal payroll taxes often confuse employees, leading to frequent inquiries. Previously, tax analysts manually typed out explanations using the FIT Steps PDF to respond to requests, which was time-consuming and inefficient. |
| **Solution**           | Developed this template to automate and streamline the explanation process, enabling faster, consistent responses to employee tax questions.                                                                                 |
| **Impact**             | The template significantly reduced manual effort and remains in use today by tax analysts to handle employee tax inquiries efficiently.                                                                                      |
